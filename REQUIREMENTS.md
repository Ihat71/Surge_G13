## Project Requirements Prioritization

### Role: Requirements Prioritization Analyst
**Task:** prioritize all project requirements into 3 categories with reasoning:
- **Mandatory (M)** - Must be included for the project to function properly.
- **Nice To Have (N)** - Adds value, and desirable but not essential.
- **Superfluous (S) ** - Extra and unnecessary for the project goal and feasibility.

## 1. Mandatory (M)

-The Robot must include an additional control for the camera to enable zoom in/out functionality.
*Reason:* to allow the Doctor to have full control over the camera.

-The camera should have a built-in light source.
*Reason:* To provide clear visibility of the area being operated on.

-The robot must include an emergency stop system.
*Reason:*in case something fails to work the robot will shutdown immediately.


## 2. Nice To Have (N)

-The robot shall provide an integrated Intraoperative Ultrasound that gives real-time information needed.
*Reason:* dangerous tumors can be hidden but with IOUS it can easily be visualized and identified.

-The robot shall support telecommunication features that enable remote telesurgery.
*Reason:* This allows top surgeons perform surgical operations from different locations with real-time control, as if physically present in the room.

-The control interface should be made with Anti-vibration materials to ensure maximum stability and precision.
*Reason:* This feature minimizes unwanted motion, making the robot as steady and accurate as possible, mainly useful for older surgeons with less steady hand control.


## 3.Superfluous (S)

-the robot shall analyze patient’s blood to determine safe / correct amount of anesthesia dosage.
*Reason:* Unnecessary, usually done by the anesthesiologists.

-the robot shall be able to store data for each patient who undergoes surgery.
*Reason:* increases complexity and requires an additional storage hardware and data management.

-The robot shall have a friendly, smiley appearance to make it look less scary for the patients.
*Reason:* completely extra, and its only for aesthetic.
