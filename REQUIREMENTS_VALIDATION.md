# Risks
There are many potential risks to careless requirements engineering in this project. In this document we will highlight two major ones: **ambiguity** and **incompleteness**
### Ambiguity
Ambigious requirements would not work for this project as that would lead to a deficient practice of the waterfall method. All of the requirements must be precise and should not lead the engineer to under-develop or over-develop a certain requirement. 

### Incompleteness
Incompleteness in requirements in this project can mean life or death. Every edge case should have a requirement to cover it, and no stones should be left unturned.

# Validation Methods
For Surge, what makes most sense to use as validation methods are: **prototyping** and **test cases**

### Prototyping
For Surge, we have decided to test and come with different prototypes before settling on a finished product. It is imperative that all the major goals we have set for Surge to be checked. One of those goals would be to successfully do a surgery on a small grape. 

### Test Cases
For the test cases, we want to make sure all the edge-cases in the robot's software are handled properly. If we find that a requirement is not testable, in that it is not measurable and therefore vague, it is up to us to review those requirements.
